# SolDev UI

The UI used to display the Solana Course at https://soldev.app

Note the main [Solana Course repo](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course) now has a smaller version of this UI included, so this repo isn't necessary for local development or production deployment on other domains.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation Steps

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. create a file called `.env.local` to setup the environment.

Since the `.env.local` file contains secrets, you will have to ask a colleague - Nick Frostbutter or Mike MacCana both have working copies of this file.

`.env.example` has a version of what it should look like.

3. Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
